<h1>Welcome to Mule iBeans!</h1>

Mule iBeans is a new platform integrating web applications with the rest of the world. Mule iBeans provides a simple API
and annotations for doing common tasks such as
<ul>
    <li>Receiving and sending Email</li>
    <li>subscribing and publishing to Jms queues and topics</li>
    <li>scheduling tasks such as polling database tables or RSS feeds</li>
    <li>Publishing REST style services using JAX-RS annotations</li>
    <li>Publishing Web Services using JAX-WS</li>
    <li>Subscribing and publishing AJAX events (Comet)</li>
    <li>and much more...</li>
</ul>

Mule iBeans also provides a revolutionary way of sharing client objects called IntegrationBeans that provide a unique
way to quickly create clients for web APIs such as Twitter, Flickr, FaceBook, Amazon WS, LinkedIn, BaseCamp and any
other service on the web that offers a public REST or Web Service API.
