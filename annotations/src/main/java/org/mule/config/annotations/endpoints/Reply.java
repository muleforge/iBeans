 * An annotation that allows developers to configure a reply channel. Mule will wait on the reply channel before
 * returning. Typically, the @Reply annotation is only used when the @Publish annotation is used, since the result of
 * dispatching to a {@link Publish} channel will be returned on the @Reply channel.
 * <p/>
 * The @Reply annotation creates an asynchronous reply channel for a remote service to reply to. In the case of
 * JMS, this would listen on the JMSReplyTo address. In the case of other Mule services, the transport can set up a
 * reply channel.
