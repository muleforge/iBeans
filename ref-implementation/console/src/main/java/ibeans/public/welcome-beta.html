    <h1 class="welcome-h1">Web Application Integration Just Got Easier</h1>

    Mule iBeans is a new platform integrating web applications with the rest of the world. Mule iBeans provides a simple
    API and annotations for doing common tasks such as sending email, talking REST, scheduling tasks, Jms, RSS/Atom and
    more.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        Mule iBeans also provides a revolutionary way of sharing client services, called iBeans (Integration Beans) that
        provide
        a unique way to quickly create clients for web APIs such as Twitter, Flickr, FaceBook, Amazon WS, LinkedIn,
        BaseCamp and
        any other service on the web that offers a public REST API or protocols such as SMTP, iMAP and XMPP.
    </p>

    <h1 class="welcome-h1">Getting Involved</h1>
    iBeans is currently in beta, this means the the core of iBeans is pretty stable but there is plenty more work
    to do. We will be releasing more iBeans to iBeans Central during the beta but would love to receive contributions.

    If you find any issues or have suggestions or ideas on how to
    improve iBeans please use the <a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/IBEANS" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
    and you can also email the <a href="mailto:user@ibeans.muleforge.org">user list</a>.
